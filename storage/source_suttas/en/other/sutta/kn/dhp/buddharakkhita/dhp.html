<h2>Pairs</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1' data-uid='dhp1'>SC 1</a>Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2' data-uid='dhp2'>SC 2</a>Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3' data-uid='dhp3'>SC 3</a>“He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me.” Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4' data-uid='dhp4'>SC 4</a>“He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me.” Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5' data-uid='dhp5'>SC 5</a>Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6' data-uid='dhp6'>SC 6</a>There are those who do not realize that one day we all must die. But those who do realize this settle their quarrels.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7' data-uid='dhp7'>SC 7</a>Just as a storm throws down a weak tree, so does Mara overpower the man who lives for the pursuit of pleasures, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in eating, indolent, and dissipated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8' data-uid='dhp8'>SC 8</a>Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain, so Mara can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities, who is controlled in his senses, moderate in eating, and filled with faith and earnest effort.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9' data-uid='dhp9'>SC 9</a>Whoever being depraved, devoid of self-control and truthfulness, should don the monk’s yellow robe, he surely is not worthy of the robe.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10' data-uid='dhp10'>SC 10</a>But whoever is purged of depravity, well-established in virtues and filled with self-control and truthfulness, he indeed is worthy of the yellow robe.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11' data-uid='dhp11'>SC 11</a>Those who mistake the unessential to be essential and the essential to be unessential, dwelling in wrong thoughts, never arrive at the essential.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12' data-uid='dhp12'>SC 12</a>Those who know the essential to be essential and the unessential to be unessential, dwelling in right thoughts, do arrive at the essential.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13' data-uid='dhp13'>SC 13</a>Just as rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14' data-uid='dhp14'>SC 14</a>Just as rain does not break through a well-thatched house, so passion never penetrates a well-developed mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15' data-uid='dhp15'>SC 15</a>The evil-doer grieves here and hereafter; he grieves in both the worlds. He laments and is afflicted, recollecting his own impure deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16' data-uid='dhp16'>SC 16</a>The doer of good rejoices here and hereafter; he rejoices in both the worlds. He rejoices and exults, recollecting his own pure deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17' data-uid='dhp17'>SC 17</a>The evil-doer suffers here and hereafter; he suffers in both the worlds. The thought, “Evil have I done,” torments him, and he suffers even more when gone to realms of woe.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18' data-uid='dhp18'>SC 18</a>The doer of good delights here and hereafter; he delights in both the worlds. The thought, “Good have I done,” delights him, and he delights even more when gone to realms of bliss.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19' data-uid='dhp19'>SC 19</a>Much though he recites the sacred texts, but acts not accordingly, that heedless man is like a cowherd who only counts the cows of others—he does not partake of the blessings of the holy life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20' data-uid='dhp20'>SC 20</a>Little though he recites the sacred texts, but puts the Teaching into practice, forsaking lust, hatred, and delusion, with true wisdom and emancipated mind, clinging to nothing of this or any other world—he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy life.</p>
<h2>Heedfulness</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21' data-uid='dhp21'>SC 21</a>Heedfulness is the path to the Deathless. Heedlessness is the path to death. The heedful die not. The heedless are as if dead already.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22' data-uid='dhp22'>SC 22</a>Clearly understanding this excellence of heedfulness, the wise exult therein and enjoy the resort of the Noble Ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23' data-uid='dhp23'>SC 23</a>The wise ones, ever meditative and steadfastly persevering, alone experience Nibbana, the incomparable freedom from bondage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24' data-uid='dhp24'>SC 24</a>Ever grows the glory of him who is energetic, mindful and pure in conduct, discerning and self-controlled, righteous and heedful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25' data-uid='dhp25'>SC 25</a>By effort and heedfulness, discipline and self-mastery, let the wise one make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26' data-uid='dhp26'>SC 26</a>The foolish and ignorant indulge in heedlessness, but the wise one keeps his heedfulness as his best treasure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27' data-uid='dhp27'>SC 27</a>Do not give way to heedlessness. Do not indulge in sensual pleasures. Only the heedful and meditative attain great happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28' data-uid='dhp28'>SC 28</a>Just as one upon the summit of a mountain beholds the groundlings, even so when the wise man casts away heedlessness by heedfulness and ascends the high tower of wisdom, this sorrowless sage beholds the sorrowing and foolish multitude.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29' data-uid='dhp29'>SC 29</a>Heedful among the heedless, wide-awake among the sleepy, the wise man advances like a swift horse leaving behind a weak jade.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30' data-uid='dhp30'>SC 30</a>By Heedfulness did Indra become the overlord of the gods. Heedfulness is ever praised, and heedlessness ever despised.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc31' href='#sc31' data-uid='dhp31'>SC 31</a>The monk who delights in heedfulness and looks with fear at heedlessness advances like fire, burning all fetters, small and large.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc32' href='#sc32' data-uid='dhp32'>SC 32</a>The monk who delights in heedfulness and looks with fear at heedlessness will not fall. He is close to Nibbana.</p>
<h2>The Mind</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33' data-uid='dhp33'>SC 33</a>Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning man straightens his mind—so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34' data-uid='dhp34'>SC 34</a>As a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers, even so is this mind agitated. Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35' data-uid='dhp35'>SC 35</a>Wonderful, indeed, it is to subdue the mind, so difficult to subdue, ever swift, and seizing whatever it desires. A tamed mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc36' href='#sc36' data-uid='dhp36'>SC 36</a>Let the discerning man guard the mind, so difficult to detect and extremely subtle, seizing whatever it desires. A guarded mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc37' href='#sc37' data-uid='dhp37'>SC 37</a>Dwelling in the cave (of the heart), the mind, without form, wanders far and alone. Those who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38' data-uid='dhp38'>SC 38</a>Wisdom never becomes perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast, who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc39' href='#sc39' data-uid='dhp39'>SC 39</a>There is no fear for an awakened one, whose mind is not sodden (by lust) nor afflicted (by hate), and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc40' href='#sc40' data-uid='dhp40'>SC 40</a>Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city, fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom. Then, guarding the conquest, remain unattached.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc41' href='#sc41' data-uid='dhp41'>SC 41</a>Ere long, alas! This body will lie upon the earth, unheeded and lifeless, like a useless log.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc42' href='#sc42' data-uid='dhp42'>SC 42</a>Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc43' href='#sc43' data-uid='dhp43'>SC 43</a>Neither mother, father, nor any other relative can do one greater good than one’s own well-directed mind.</p>
<h2>Flowers</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44' data-uid='dhp44'>SC 44</a>Who shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods? Who shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom as an expert garland-maker would his floral design?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc45' href='#sc45' data-uid='dhp45'>SC 45</a>A striver-on-the path shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods. The striver-on-the-path shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom, as an expert garland-maker would his floral design.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46' data-uid='dhp46'>SC 46</a>Realizing that this body is like froth, penetrating its mirage-like nature, and plucking out Mara’s flower-tipped arrows of sensuality, go beyond sight of the King of Death!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47' data-uid='dhp47'>SC 47</a>As a mighty flood sweeps away the sleeping village, so death carries away the person of distracted mind who only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48' data-uid='dhp48'>SC 48</a>The Destroyer brings under his sway the person of distracted mind who, insatiate in sense desires, only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49' data-uid='dhp49'>SC 49</a>As a bee gathers honey from the flower without injuring its color or fragrance, even so the sage goes on his alms-round in the village.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc50' href='#sc50' data-uid='dhp50'>SC 50</a>Let none find fault with others; let none see the omissions and commissions of others. But let one see one’s own acts, done and undone.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc51' href='#sc51' data-uid='dhp51'>SC 51</a>Like a beautiful flower full of color but without fragrance, even so, fruitless are the fair words of one who does not practice them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc52' href='#sc52' data-uid='dhp52'>SC 52</a>Like a beautiful flower full of color and also fragrant, even so, fruitful are the fair words of one who practices them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc53' href='#sc53' data-uid='dhp53'>SC 53</a>As from a great heap of flowers many garlands can be made, even so should many good deeds be done by one born a mortal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc54' href='#sc54' data-uid='dhp54'>SC 54</a>Not the sweet smell of flowers, not even the fragrance of sandal, <i>tagara,</i> or jasmine blows against the wind. But the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the wind. Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtue.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc55' href='#sc55' data-uid='dhp55'>SC 55</a>Of all the fragrances—sandal, <i>tagara,</i> blue lotus and jasmine—the fragrance of virtue is the sweetest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc56' href='#sc56' data-uid='dhp56'>SC 56</a>Faint is the fragrance of <i>tagara</i> and sandal, but excellent is the fragrance of the virtuous, wafting even amongst the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc57' href='#sc57' data-uid='dhp57'>SC 57</a>Mara never finds the path of the truly virtuous, who abide in heedfulness and are freed by perfect knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc58' href='#sc58' data-uid='dhp58'>SC 58</a>Upon a heap of rubbish in the road-side ditch blooms a lotus, fragrant and pleasing.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc59' href='#sc59' data-uid='dhp59'>SC 59</a>Even so, on the rubbish heap of blinded mortals the disciple of the Supremely Enlightened One shines resplendent in wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Fool</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc60' href='#sc60' data-uid='dhp60'>SC 60</a>Long is the night to the sleepless; long is the league to the weary. Long is worldly existence to fools who know not the Sublime Truth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc61' href='#sc61' data-uid='dhp61'>SC 61</a>Should a seeker not find a companion who is better or equal, let him resolutely pursue a solitary course; there is no fellowship with the fool.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc62' href='#sc62' data-uid='dhp62'>SC 62</a>The fool worries, thinking, “I have sons, I have wealth.” Indeed, when he himself is not his own, whence are sons, whence is wealth?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc63' href='#sc63' data-uid='dhp63'>SC 63</a>A fool who knows his foolishness is wise at least to that extent, but a fool who thinks himself wise is a fool indeed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc64' href='#sc64' data-uid='dhp64'>SC 64</a>Though all his life a fool associates with a wise man, he no more comprehends the Truth than a spoon tastes the flavor of the soup.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc65' href='#sc65' data-uid='dhp65'>SC 65</a>Though only for a moment a discerning person associates with a wise man, quickly he comprehends the Truth, just as the tongue tastes the flavor of the soup.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc66' href='#sc66' data-uid='dhp66'>SC 66</a>Fools of little wit are enemies unto themselves as they move about doing evil deeds, the fruits of which are bitter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc67' href='#sc67' data-uid='dhp67'>SC 67</a>Ill done is that action of doing which one repents later, and the fruit of which one, weeping, reaps with tears.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc68' href='#sc68' data-uid='dhp68'>SC 68</a>Well done is that action of doing which one repents not later, and the fruit of which one reaps with delight and happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc69' href='#sc69' data-uid='dhp69'>SC 69</a>So long as an evil deed has not ripened, the fool thinks it as sweet as honey. But when the evil deed ripens, the fool comes to grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc70' href='#sc70' data-uid='dhp70'>SC 70</a>Month after month a fool may eat his food with the tip of a blade of grass, but he still is not worth a sixteenth part of the those who have comprehended the Truth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc71' href='#sc71' data-uid='dhp71'>SC 71</a>Truly, an evil deed committed does not immediately bear fruit, like milk that does not turn sour all at once. But smoldering, it follows the fool like fire covered by ashes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc72' href='#sc72' data-uid='dhp72'>SC 72</a>To his own ruin the fool gains knowledge, for it cleaves his head and destroys his innate goodness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc73' href='#sc73' data-uid='dhp73'>SC 73</a>The fool seeks undeserved reputation, precedence among monks, authority over monasteries, and honor among householders.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc74' href='#sc74' data-uid='dhp74'>SC 74</a>“Let both laymen and monks think that it was done by me. In every work, great and small, let them follow me”—such is the ambition of the fool; thus his desire and pride increase.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc75' href='#sc75' data-uid='dhp75'>SC 75</a>One is the quest for worldly gain, and quite another is the path to Nibbana. Clearly understanding this, let not the monk, the disciple of the Buddha, be carried away by worldly acclaim, but develop detachment instead.</p>
<h2>The Wise</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc76' href='#sc76' data-uid='dhp76'>SC 76</a>Should one find a man who points out faults and who reproves, let him follow such a wise and sagacious person as one would a guide to hidden treasure. It is always better, and never worse, to cultivate such an association.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc77' href='#sc77' data-uid='dhp77'>SC 77</a>Let him admonish, instruct and shield one from wrong; he, indeed, is dear to the good and detestable to the evil.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc78' href='#sc78' data-uid='dhp78'>SC 78</a>Do not associate with evil companions; do not seek the fellowship of the vile. Associate with the good friends; seek the fellowship of noble men.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc79' href='#sc79' data-uid='dhp79'>SC 79</a>He who drinks deep the Dhamma lives happily with a tranquil mind. The wise man ever delights in the Dhamma made known by the Noble One (the Buddha).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc80' href='#sc80' data-uid='dhp80'>SC 80</a>Irrigators regulate the rivers; fletchers straighten the arrow shaft; carpenters shape the wood; the wise control themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc81' href='#sc81' data-uid='dhp81'>SC 81</a>Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc82' href='#sc82' data-uid='dhp82'>SC 82</a>On hearing the Teachings, the wise become perfectly purified, like a lake deep, clear and still.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc83' href='#sc83' data-uid='dhp83'>SC 83</a>The good renounce (attachment for) everything. The virtuous do not prattle with a yearning for pleasures. The wise show no elation or depression when touched by happiness or sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc84' href='#sc84' data-uid='dhp84'>SC 84</a>He is indeed virtuous, wise, and righteous who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another (does any wrong), who does not crave for sons, wealth, or kingdom, and does not desire success by unjust means.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc85' href='#sc85' data-uid='dhp85'>SC 85</a>Few among men are those who cross to the farther shore. The rest, the bulk of men, only run up and down the hither bank.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc86' href='#sc86' data-uid='dhp86'>SC 86</a>But those who act according to the perfectly taught Dhamma will cross the realm of Death, so difficult to cross.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc87' href='#sc87' data-uid='dhp87'>SC 87</a><a class='ref sc' id='sc88' href='#sc88' data-uid='dhp88'>SC 88</a>Abandoning the dark way, let the wise man cultivate the bright path. Having gone from home to homelessness, let him yearn for that delight in detachment, so difficult to enjoy. Giving up sensual pleasures, with no attachment, let the wise man cleanse himself of defilements of the mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc89' href='#sc89' data-uid='dhp89'>SC 89</a>Those whose minds have reached full excellence in the factors of enlightenment, who, having renounced acquisitiveness, rejoice in not clinging to things—rid of cankers, glowing with wisdom, they have attained Nibbana in this very life.</p>
<h2>The Arahant or Perfected One</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc90' href='#sc90' data-uid='dhp90'>SC 90</a>The fever of passion exists not for him who has completed the journey, who is sorrowless and wholly set free, and has broken all ties.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc91' href='#sc91' data-uid='dhp91'>SC 91</a>The mindful ones exert themselves. They are not attached to any home; like swans that abandon the lake, they leave home after home behind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc92' href='#sc92' data-uid='dhp92'>SC 92</a>Those who do not accumulate and are wise regarding food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom—their track cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc93' href='#sc93' data-uid='dhp93'>SC 93</a>He whose cankers are destroyed and who is not attached to food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom—his path cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc94' href='#sc94' data-uid='dhp94'>SC 94</a>Even the gods hold dear the wise one, whose senses are subdued like horses well trained by a charioteer, whose pride is destroyed and who is free from the cankers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc95' href='#sc95' data-uid='dhp95'>SC 95</a>There is no more worldly existence for the wise one who, like the earth, resents nothing, who is firm as a high pillar and as pure as a deep pool free from mud.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc96' href='#sc96' data-uid='dhp96'>SC 96</a>Calm is his thought, calm his speech, and calm his deed, who, truly knowing, is wholly freed, perfectly tranquil and wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc97' href='#sc97' data-uid='dhp97'>SC 97</a>The man who is without blind faith, who knows the Uncreated, who has severed all links, destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil), and thrown out all desires—he, truly, is the most excellent of men.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc98' href='#sc98' data-uid='dhp98'>SC 98</a>Inspiring, indeed, is that place where Arahants dwell, be it a village, a forest, a vale, or a hill.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc99' href='#sc99' data-uid='dhp99'>SC 99</a>Inspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasure. There the passionless will rejoice, for they seek no sensual pleasures.</p>
<h2>The Thousands</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc100' href='#sc100' data-uid='dhp100'>SC 100</a>Better than a thousand useless words is one useful word, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc101' href='#sc101' data-uid='dhp101'>SC 101</a>Better than a thousand useless verses is one useful verse, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc102' href='#sc102' data-uid='dhp102'>SC 102</a>Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc103' href='#sc103' data-uid='dhp103'>SC 103</a>Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself.</p>

Not even a god, an angel, Mara or Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is self-subdued and ever restrained in conduct.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc106' href='#sc106' data-uid='dhp106'>SC 106</a>Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc107' href='#sc107' data-uid='dhp107'>SC 107</a>Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds, that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc108' href='#sc108' data-uid='dhp108'>SC 108</a>Whatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year, all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones, which is truly excellent.</p>
