<h1>3.12. Observation of Dualities</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī at the eastern Monastery, the mansion of Migāra’s Mother. Now at that time the Buddha was seating in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. It was the <i>uposatha</i> day, the night of the fifteenth day full moon. Then the Buddha, having surveyed the Saṅgha of monks sitting silently, addressed the bhikkhus:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Bhikkhus, if they ask you, ‘What is the purpose of learning those skilful principles that are noble, emancipating, leading to full enlightenment?’ You should say to them, ‘Only for the sake of knowing in accordance with reality the duality of principles.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“What duality should you speak of?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“‘This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering’, this is one observation. ‘This is the end of suffering, this is the practice leading to the end of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>

Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return.”</p>
